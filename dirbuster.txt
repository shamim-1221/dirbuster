DirBuster is a multi threaded java application designed to brute force directories and files names on web/application servers. Often is the case now of what looks like a web server in a state of default installation is actually not, and has pages and applications hidden within. DirBuster attempts to find these.

However tools of this nature are often as only good as the directory and file list they come with. A different approach was taken to generating this. The list was generated from scratch, by crawling the Internet and collecting the directory and files that are actually used by developers! DirBuster comes a total of 9 different lists, this makes DirBuster extremely effective at finding those hidden files and directories. And if that was not enough DirBuster also has the option to perform a pure brute force, which leaves the hidden directories and files nowhere to hide.
DirBuster is a penetration testing tool with a Graphic User Interface (GUI) that is used to brute force directories and file names on web and application servers. You can also use DIRB for this challenge if you enjoy command line and want to figure that out, but I prefer GUI applications so that’s how I’ll demonstrating this type of challenge.

Keep in mind that both of these tools are preloaded into Kali Linux, so as long as you have your Kali VM set up, you should be good to go! If not, there are a couple of blogs posted which you can find here and here, so pick the one that is easier for you to follow along with and get yourself set up.
